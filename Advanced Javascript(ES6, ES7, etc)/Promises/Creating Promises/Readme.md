# Promises

- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise
- The `Promise` object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value.
- That is, It allows you work with a value we don't know yet. When your work is done, please give it back to me

## Arg

- Resolve: Hey this is a value. Give it back to Javascript
- reject: Sorry, there is an error
