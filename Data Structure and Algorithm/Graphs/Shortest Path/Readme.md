# Shortest path algorithm

## Dijkstra's algorithm

- Dijkstra's algorithm is a **greedy algorithm** to calculate the shortest path between a single source and all the other source, meaning we can use it to calculate the shortest path from a graph vertex to all the other vertices.

## The Floyd-Warshall algorithm

- The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a **dynamic programming algorithm** to calculate all the shortest paths on a graph
