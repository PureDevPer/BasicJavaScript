# Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

## Prim's algorithm

- Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds an MST problem for a connected weighted undirected graph
- It finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized

## Kruskal's algorithm

- Kruskal's algorithm is a greedy algorith, that finds the MST for a connected weighted undirected graph
